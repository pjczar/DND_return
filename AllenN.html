                        Born as a commoner he became disillusioned and aimless. At the age of 17, in a drunken wander into a forest, Allen was attacked by an ogre and suffered head trauma rendering him deaf. Luckily a Drow caravan happened upon the ogre and saved him. They took him in while he healed and Allen lived with them for many years. Learning their language, lipreading and sign language, he repayed his debt over time through protective service for his new family and painting their portraits. Now 38 he ventures abroad to help those in danger.
